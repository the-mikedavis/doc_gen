# DocGen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/the-mikedavis/doc_gen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/the-mikedavis/doc_gen)

A reduced-bias way to create documentaries.

## Technologies

This project uses some cool new tech:

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): a dynamically typed functional language with great concurrency support and low latency. I use Elixir for all back-end logic.
* [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/): Rails is to Ruby as Phoenix is to Elixir. Phoenix makes it easy to write a web-app backend in Elixir.
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): An open-source and easy to use database. Postgres manages all long-term state like information on videos and accounts.
* [Slime](https://slime-lang.com/): Slim HTML with support for templating in Elixir. All pages are rendered using compiled Slime.
* [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/): a statically typed functional language that transpiles to JavaScript. I use Elm on the front-end the same way you might use React or Angular: for dynamically modifying the DOM and doing socket operations.
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.INDENTED_SYNTAX.html): a suped-up CSS with minimal syntax. Sass handles all stylization.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): A build tool for front-end assets. Webpack automatically organizes and transpiles all front-end assets.
